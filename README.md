Telegraph equations are often used to model the propagation of energy through a medium. These differential equations describe transport which could be multidimensional. Many algorithms have been developed to solve these equations amongst which is the alternating direction implicit (ADI) solver. The ADI solver is a finite difference numerical analysis method for solving differential equations in multiple dimensions. Unlike other algorithms, the ADI solver performs multiple sub-iterations based on the spatial dimensions of the problem to advance from the nth to the (n+1)th time step.

  Let   ∂2u∂t2= c2 ( ∂2u∂x2 + ∂2u∂y2 + ∂2u∂z2 ) be a 3D telegraph equation.
